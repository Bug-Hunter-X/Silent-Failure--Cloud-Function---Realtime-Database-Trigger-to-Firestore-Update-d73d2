# Silent Failure: Firebase Cloud Function - Realtime Database Trigger to Firestore Update

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Firebase Cloud Function silently fails to update a Firestore document when triggered by a change in the Realtime Database.  The function executes without throwing any errors or logging any useful information to the console.

The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.

## Bug
The problem lies in the lack of proper error handling and potential asynchronous issues when interacting with the Firestore database.

## Solution
The solution involves more robust error handling to catch and report exceptions during the Firestore update.  Additionally, ensuring proper asynchronous operation is crucial.  The solution file demonstrates improved error handling and updated code.

## Reproduction
1.  Ensure you have the Firebase CLI installed and initialized a project.
2.  Deploy the `bug.js` function using `firebase deploy --only functions`. Observe it fails silently.
3.  Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and redeploy.  The fix will now properly handle errors and report them to the console.
